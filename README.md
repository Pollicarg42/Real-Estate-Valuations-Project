## Objective
This project aimed to showcase skills in python for data analysis specifically sourcing open data and exploring it using supervised/unsupervised machine learning. The data was sourced from publicly shared data in Kaggle and Quandl libraries. The data was analyzed using Pandas and visualizations were made using matplotlib libraries. The deliverable for this exercise are the python code in Jupyter notebooks under Scrypts, a Tableau presentation, and a powerpoint presentation. 

## Real Estate Analysis Project Details:
This project consists of analyzing open sourced real estate data from Kaggle. This real estate data was used in an analysis to determine key variables that can be used to identify if a property listing entries were overpriced or undervalued. The project consists of using many statistical and programming tools to explore relationships between variables, visualize geographical data, and build regression models and cluster profiles of data points. 

## Skills Developed in this Project:
### Source and Clean Data for Analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sourcing and exploring open sourced data, geographic libraries (Folium), Time Series (Quandl)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merging and formatting attributes. 

### Using Geographic Data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use library Folium to conduct geospatial analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generated chloropleth visualizations with sourced data. 

### Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regression analysis of real estate data variables
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clustering and Time Series analysis

## Data Sources Used:
### Property Listings From Realtor.com
14 million entries of properties in the Northeast region. 
Contains property price listings, number of beds/bathrooms, 
Available floor space in Total Square foot, Total Lot size in Acreage. 
It covers 2009-2023, Sourced from Kaggle.
Limitations: Only sourced from Realtors.com and no other reliable real estate listings service. Biased towards Northeastern United States properties.
